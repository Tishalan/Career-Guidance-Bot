# 🎓 Career Buddy — Career Guidance Bot

An AI-powered chatbot that guides students on international education — diplomas, degrees, masters, student visas, costs, and study options in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand.

Built with **Flask**, **scikit-learn**, and **NLTK**, the bot uses keyword/pattern matching combined with a trained ML model to answer student queries instantly through a simple web chat interface.

## 📌 Features

- 💬 Real-time chat interface (no page reload — AJAX-based)
- 📚 36+ topics covered — qualification levels (Diploma, HND, Top-up Degree, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), country guides, visas, costs, scholarships, IELTS, accommodation, and more
- 🧠 Two-layer answer engine: fast keyword matching + ML model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) fallback for fuzzy/unseen questions
- 🚫 Basic profanity filter using NLTK tokenization
- 🗂️ Easy-to-edit knowledge base (`intents.json`) — add new topics without touching code
- 🖥️ Clean, responsive chat UI built with Bootstrap

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User Message
     │
     ▼
1️⃣  Keyword/Pattern Matching → exact match, contains-match, word-overlap scoring
     │  (no match)
     ▼
2️⃣  ML Model Prediction → TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (confidence ≥ 0.12)
     │  (no confident match)
     ▼
3️⃣  Fallback Response → "I'm not sure I understood that..."
```

Every word is also checked against a blocked-words list before processing, to filter out inappropriate input.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/career_guidance_bot.git
cd career_guidance_bot/career_bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### (Optional) Re-train the model
Run this only if you've edited `intents.json`:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Run the app
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🧩 Adding New Topics

To teach the bot a new topic, just add a new entry to `intents.json`:

```json
{
  "tag": "new_topic",
  "patterns": ["example question 1", "example question 2"],
  "responses": ["Your answer here"]
}
```

No code changes needed. Re-run `train_model.py` afterward so the ML fallback also learns the new patterns.
